# Running Service Methods in a Worker

The worker bundle gives you the ability to run any registered service method in a worker process
and get back the results.

Note: this will always return a Promise. If your service method directly returns a result, it will
be passed in the Promise's resolve method.

Example:

```js
this.container.get('conga.worker').get('my.service').hello('joe').then((result) => {
    res.return(result);
});
```
