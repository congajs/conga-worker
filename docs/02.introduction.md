# Introduction

The worker bundle provides the ability for you to create workers in your application which run
in forked processes which have full access to the conga.js framework.

You can either create worker classes which can send back events to the main HTTP process or call
existing service methods in your application which are then run in a background worker process.

## How It Works

When the worker bundle is enabled and your HTTP application boots up, it will create a pool of
forked worker processes which are ready to receive messages.
