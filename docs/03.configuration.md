worker:

    # If true, stdin, stdout, and stderr of the child will be piped to the parent,
    # otherwise they will be inherited from the parent
    silent: false

    pool:

        # the number of worker processes to pool (this can be a number or 'auto' to use all processors)
        size: auto

        # specify the app name to use for pool (null will use current app)
        app: null
